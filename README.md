# XEventNet: Extreme Weather Event Prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks and In Situ Visualization
This project is a work for the paper titled "XEventNet: Extreme Weather Event Prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks and In Situ Visualization". 
The project predicts 4 extreme events from WRF simulation data. The extreme events include landslides, cyclones, heavy rainfalls, and snowfalls. 
The extreme event data is then visualized by Visit.
